<b>Planning</b>

I first of all took time to read about what was required for the game Project in [game project](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project). I then started my planning and figuring out how I would go about creating the Tic Tac Toe game. I then created some simple wireframes for my idea of the game and generated some user stories. I then discovered that there was a perfect [suggested schedule](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/blob/master/schedule.md) which I chose to follow because of how things were building onto each other. It was a good schedule because it helped me manage my time and keep track of the tasks I had finished and those I had left to complete.
The development process was not an easy one for me as a new programmer but when I encountered a problem, I first tried to solve it for sometime on my own using online resources like stackoverflow, MDN, google and when that failed I would consult with some of my colleagues. If all of that still failed, I would post an issue in the [project issue queue](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/issues) and I would get help from my instructors.


<b>Unsolved tasks/ Future features</b>
- Connecting to the Game API.
- Improve the CSS so it is more user friendly and responsive to different screen sizes.

<b>User Stories</b>

As a game player, I want to be able to
- Sign in and sign out of the game.
- Know when I successfully sign in to the game.
- Know whose turn it is to play.
- Know the result of the game (win, draw).
- Know when the game is over.
- Know when I make an invalid move.
